# Shell

In this page will refer as shell to the device that allows to communicate with the system, including terminal,
shells and control characters (think about ``Ctrl-v`` in the shell).

Normally in the interaction with a client you have to take into account

 - the terminal
 - the shell
 - the application

so, if we want to rename a file named ``-|^C`` to ``foo`` you  have to issue the following
keys sequence

    m v Space . / - \ | Ctrl-V Ctrl-C Space f o o Return

into the terminal.

Take into account also the path separator and the syntax behind it.
